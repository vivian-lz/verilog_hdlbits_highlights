# verilog_hdlbits_highlights
I am highlighting the project-like coding problem sets I have done on hdlbits to learn Verilog. I will utilize these skills to later complete more advanced HDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog projects. I utilized this website when taking ECE 2123: Digital Systems during my sophomore spring semester, and I am using it once again to review these concepts and practice them in more depth.
